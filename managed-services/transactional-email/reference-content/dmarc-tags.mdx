With [DMARC](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#dmarc-record), domain owners publish a [policy](#dmarc-policy) in their DNS records, specifying what actions should be taken when an incoming email fails authentication checks.

When setting up DMARC, you can include specific tags in your DNS records to define your policy and reporting preferences. These tags include information like the policy to be enforced (`p` tag), the percentage of emails to apply the policy to (`pct` tag), and the email address to which DMARC reports should be sent (`rua` and `ruf` tags).

This documentation provides information about the mandatory and optional tags to configure when [adding a DMARC record](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/add-dmarc-record/) to your domain, what they mean, the expected value for them, and their default value.

## DMARC Policy

DMARC policies specify how receiving email servers should handle messages that fail authentication checks (SPF and/or DKIM) for the domain.
The three main DMARC policies are:

- none: No action is taken by the receiving mail servers based on DMARC authentication results. This policy allows domain owners to assess the impact of DMARC enforcement on their email traffic without risking legitimate emails being blocked or sent to spam. It is used for monitoring and collecting data without impacting email delivery.

- quarantine: suspicious emails that fail DMARC authentication are marked as spam or sent to a quarantine folder by the receiving mail server.

- reject: emails that fail the DMARC authentication are rejected by the receiving mail server, and not delivered. This policy provides maximum protection against email spoofing or phishing attacks.

## DMARC Reporting

DMARC reporting involves the collection and analysis of DMARC reports generated by receiving mail servers.
These reports provide domain owners with valuable insights into their email authentication status, including authentication successes, failures, and sources of spoofed emails.
There are two main types of DMARC reports:

- aggregate reports (`rua`): aggregate reports provide data about a domain's email authentication activity. These reports include information such as the volume of emails received, the percentage of emails that pass or fail DMARC checks, and the sources of failed authentication.

- forensic reports (`ruf`): forensic reports provide detailed information about individual email messages that fail DMARC authentication. They include the complete headers and body of the failed emails, details of the authentication checks performed, and any errors encountered.
