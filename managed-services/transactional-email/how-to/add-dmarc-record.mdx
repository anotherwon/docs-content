This page shows you how to configure a [DMARC record](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#dmarc-record) on your domain from the **Scaleway console**.
If you have registered a domain at another provider, you can still use this documentation, as the process is similar.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com/).
  - You have a domain name.
  - You have [configured your domain with Transactional Email](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email).
  - You have configured SPF and DKIM records on your domain.
</Message>

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.
2. Click your domain. You are redirected to the records configuration page.
3. Add a `TXT` record type in the root zone of your domain on your DNS zone.
4. Enter `_dmarc` in the **Name** field, followed by the domain name. For example, if your domain is called `my-domain.com`, you should have `_dmarc.my-domain.com.` in the **Name** field.
5. Enter your desired tags and their values in the **Value** section. Make sure that you add the mandatory `p` and `v` tags, and that you separate tags from each other with semi-colons. Find out about DMARC configuration options in our [dedicated documentation](/managed-services/transactional-email/reference-content/dmarc-configuration/).
    Your **Value** field should look similar to the following:
    ```
    v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:your@email.com
    ```
6. Click **Add record**.
