This page shows you how to configure a basic [DMARC record](/managed-services/transactional-email/concepts/#dmarc-record) on your domain from the **Scaleway console**.
If you have registered a domain at another provider, you can still use this documentation, as the process is similar.
For more information about DMARC configuration and examples of DMARC records you can configure, refer to the [dedicated documentation](/managed-services/transactional-email/reference-content/dmarc-configuration/).

## Requirements

- A Scaleway account logged into the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/).
- Have a domain name.
- Have [configured your domain with Transactional Email](/managed-services/transactional-email/how-to/configure-domain-with-transactional-email).
- Be the [Owner](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#owner) of the Organization in which the actions will be performed, or an IAM user with the [necessary permissions](/identity-and-access-management/iam/concepts/#permission)

## How to configure a DMARC record

1. Click **Transactional Email** in the **Managed Services** section of the [console](https://console.scaleway.com/) side menu.
2. Click your domain. You are redirected to the records configuration page.
3. Add a `TXT` record type in the same zone as your Transactional Email's domain, on your DNS zone.
4. Enter `_dmarc` in the **Name** field, followed by the domain name. For example, if your domain is called `my-domain.com`, you should have `_dmarc.my-domain.com.` in the **Name** field.
5. Enter your desired tags and their values in the **Value** section. Make sure that you add the mandatory `v` and `p` tags, and that you separate tags from each other with semi-colons. Find out about DMARC configuration in our [dedicated documentation](/managed-services/transactional-email/reference-content/dmarc-configuration/).
    Your **Value** field should look similar to the following
    ```
    v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:your@email.com
    ```
    <Message type="important">
     It is possible to configure several DMARC records for one domain, but they must have a different name to be valid.
     For example, the `_dmarc.mydomain.com` and `_dmarc.tem.mydomain.com` DMARC records are valid.
    </Message>
6. Click **Add record**.

<Message type="important">
  Emails sent from sources not configured in your SPF record, or that do not have a DKIM **will be rejected if you use the `p=reject` policy**.
</Message>
