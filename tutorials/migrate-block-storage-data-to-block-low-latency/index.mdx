This tutorial shows you how to migrate your Instance's data from a Block Storage volume (b_ssd) to a Block Storage Low Latency volume.

1. Create a [Block Storage Low Latency volume](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/) and [attach it](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume/) to your Instance.
2. [Mount the Block Storage Low Latency volume](/storage/block/api-cli/managing-a-volume/#mounting-and-using-a-block-storage-volume) on your Instance.
