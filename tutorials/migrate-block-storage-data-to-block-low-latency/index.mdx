This tutorial shows you how to migrate your Instance's data from a Block Storage volume (b_ssd) to a Block Storage Low Latency volume using.
Note that your Operating System and the volume on which you have stored it, cannot be migrated to a Block Storage Low Latency volume.

  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created an SSH key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key/)
  - You have [created an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance/) and [attached a Block SSD volume](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume/) to it, containing data to migrate
  - Your Instance's OS is not hosted on the Block SSD volume that contains the data you want to migrate
</Message>

<Message type="tip">
  We recommend that you make a backup of your data using the [snapshot](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) feature before migrating your data. This helps you avoid any potential data loss.

## Migrating data with Logical Volume Management (LVM)

Logical volume management combines physical volumes into volume groups to unify the storage space available on your Instance.

1. Create a [Block Storage Low Latency volume](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/) and [attach it](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume/) to your Instance.
2. Open a terminal and connect to your Instance using SSH:
  ```
  ssh root@<Your Instance's IP>
  ```
3. Use the following command to identify the Block SSD volume (source volume) and the Low Latency volume (target volume). In this tutorial, `/dev/sdb` is the SSD Block volume, and `dev/sdc` is the Low Latency volume.
  ```
  cat /proc/mounts
  ```
4. Run the following command to create physical volumes with LVM. Make sure that you replace `/dev/sdb` with your source volume and `/dev/sdc` with your target volume.
  ```
  # Create physical volumes with /dev/sdb being the source volume and /dev/sdc being the target volume
  pvcreate /dev/sdb /dev/sdc

5. Run the following command to create a volume group for both volumes:
  ```
  # Create a volume group (VG) for both volumes
  vgcreate my_volume_group /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
  ```
6. Optionally, if you have already created a volume group with your source volume in it, run the following command to add your target volume to the same volume group:
  ```
  # Add your target volume in the same volume group as the source volume
  vgextend my_volume_group /dev/sdc

7. Use the following command to move your data from your source volume to your target volume:
  ```
  # Move your data from /dev/sdb to /dev/sdc
  pvmove -b /dev/sdb/dev/sdc
  ```
8. Use the following command to monitor the data migration process:
  ```
  watch lvs -a -o+devices
  ```
9. Once the migration is complete, run the following command to remove your source volume from your volume group. This means your volume group will no longer consider your source volume as part of its storage pool.
  ```
  vgreduce my_volume_group /dev/sdb
  ```
10. Use the following command to remove the physical volume from your source volume:
  ```
  # Remove all LVM-related metadata from your source volume
  pvremove /dev/sdb
  ```
11. Restart your applications.
12. Reboot your Instance and check that your applications are running.
13. Optionally, wait a few days and delete the SSD volume.

## Migrating data without Partition Table and LVM

<Message type="important">
  To follow this procedure, you must have mounted your source volume to your Instance beforehand.
</Message>

1. Create a [Block Storage Low Latency volume](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/) and [attach it](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume/) to your Instance.
2. Open a terminal and connect to your Instance using SSH:
  ```
  ssh root@<Your Instance's IP>
  ```
3. Use the following command to make a copy of your Instance's `fstab` file:
  ```
  # This command creates an exact copy of the /etc/fstab file named fstab.backup

  cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.backup
  ```
4. Stop any applications and/or services that may be accessing the data on the source volume.
5. [Unmount your source volume](/storage/block/api-cli/unmounting-a-volume/) from your Instance.
6. Use the following command to copy your source volume (`/dev/sdb`) to your target volume (`/dev/sdc`) block by block.
  ```
  # Replace /dev/sdb with your source volume and /dev/sdc with your target volume
  # This command means that you are copying data from /dev/sdy to /dev/sdz, using a block size of 4 KB, and displaying progress information while copying.

  dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sdc bs=4096 status=progress
  ```
7. Update your Instance's `fstab` file:
  ```
  # Make sure that your replace `/dev/sdb` with `/dev/sdc`

  nano /etc/fstab
  ```
8. Press `Ctrl O` and `Enter` to save your changes, then press `Ctril X` to exit.
9. Mount your volume:
  ```
  # This command mounts all filesystems listed in /etc/fstab that are not already mounted
  mount -a
  ```
10. Start your applications/services.







## Without LVM but with Partition Table

### Creating your volume and its Partition Table

1. Create a [Block Storage Low Latency volume](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-volume/) and [attach it](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume/) to your Instance.
2. Use the following command to create a partition table on your volume:
  ```
  fdisk /dev/sdc
  ```
3. Run the following commands to mount your volume and its partition on your Instance:
  ```
  # Replace sdc1 with the partition on your Block Low Latency volume
  mkdir /mnt/volume-low-latency
  mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/volume-low-latency
  ```
    <Message type="tip">
      We recommend that you stop any applications and/or services that may be accessing the data on the volumes before proceeding with the migration.
    </Message>
4. Mount your partition tables:
  ```
  mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/
3. Use the following command to identify which volume is the Block SSD volume and which is the Low Latency volume. In this tutorial, `/dev/sdb` is the SSD Block volume, and `dev/sdc` is the Low Latency volume.
  ```
  cat /proc/mounts
  ```
4. Copy your 

## Making a copy of a Block Storage SSD volume






1. Copy the data you wish to migrate from your Block SSD volume using the `pvmove` command:
  ```
  pvmove -b /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
  ```
