<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [configured your SSH key](/console/project/how-to/create-ssh-key)
  - You have an [Instance](/compute/instances/concepts/#instance)
  - You have [attached](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume/) an additional Block Storage volume to your Instance
</Message>

This documentation only explains how to mount **additional block volumes to your Instance**, as the root volume of your Instance is already mounted at creation. The volume where your OS is running cannot be mounted.

## Mounting and using a Block Storage volume

In order to mount and use your Block Storage volume, you need to connect to the Instance it is attached to, via SSH.
Then, check that the volume is available, format it, and mount it following the instructions below.

### Verifying device availability

1. Connect to your Instance with `ssh`.
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Use the `lsblk` command to make sure your block volume is available:
    ```
    lsblk
    ```

  You should see an output similar to the following. The root Block volume `sda`, runs your OS. The Block volume named `sdb` is the one we will be mounting to the Instance.

  ```sh no-copy
  root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk
  NAME    MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
  loop0     7:0    0  63.5M  1 loop /snap/core20/2015
  loop1     7:1    0 111.9M  1 loop /snap/lxd/24322
  loop2     7:2    0  40.9M  1 loop /snap/snapd/20290
  sda       8:0    0  23.3G  0 disk
  ├─sda1    8:1    0  23.2G  0 part /
  ├─sda14   8:14   0     4M  0 part
  └─sda15   8:15   0   106M  0 part /boot/efi
  sdb       8:16   0  27.9G  0 disk
  ```

### Partitioning your volume

Partitioning your volume allows you to organize its storage into units. You can partition your volumes using tools such as `fdisk` or `parted`. For the sake of this documentation, we are using `fdisk`.

1. Connect to your Instance with `ssh`.
    ```
    ssh root@<your_instance_ip>
    ```
2. Install `fdisk`
  ```
  apt-get install fdisk
  ```
3. Run the following command to partition your volume. Make sure that you replace `/dev/sdb` with your the volume you want to partition.
  ```
  fdisk /dev/sdb
  ```
4. Type `n` to create a new partition.
5. Type `p` or `e` to select between a `primary` or an `extended` partition type.
6. Select a partition number from 1 to 4. Enter if you want to select the default number.
7. Select a first sector. Enter if you want to select the default sector.
8. Select the last sector. Enter if you want to select the default sector.
9. Type `w` to save your changes.

  ```sh no-copy
  Command (m for help): n
  Partition type
   p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
   e   extended (container for logical partitions)
  Select (default p): p
  Partition number (1-4, default 1): 1
  First sector (8192-58593749, default 8192):
  Last sector, +/-sectors or +/-size{K,M,G,T,P} (8192-58593749, default 58593749):
  ```


  Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 27.9 GiB.

  Command (m for help): w
  The partition table has been altered.
  Syncing disks.
  ```
10. Run the following command to see your partition:
  ```
  fdisk -l
  ```
  You should see an output similar to the following:

  ``` sh no-copy
  root@@scw-festive-agnesi:~# fdisk -l /dev/sdb
  Disk /dev/sdb: 27.94 GiB, 30000000000 bytes, 58593750 sectors
  Disk model: b_ssd
  Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
  Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
  I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4194304 bytes
  Disklabel type: dos
  Disk identifier: 0xf29b4308

  Device     Boot Start      End  Sectors  Size Id Type
  /dev/sdb1        8192 58593749 58585558 27.9G 83 Linux
  ```

### Formatting your volume

After partitioning your volume, you need to format the partitions with a filesystem. This step prepares the volume for storing files.

1. Create a filesystem with the following command. This command uses the `ext4` filesystem, though you can choose another if you prefer.
    ```
    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb
    ```
2. Make sure your filesystem is correctly created by running the `lsblk -f` command.
    ```
    lsblk -f
    ```

  You should see an output similar to the following. Check that the `FSTYPE` field matches `ext4` for your Block volume.

  ```sh no-copy
  root@scw-festive-agnesi:~# lsblk -f
  NAME  FSTYPE FSVER LABEL         UUID                                 FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINTS
  loop0 squash 4.0                                                            0   100% /snap/core20/2015
  loop1 squash 4.0                                                            0   100% /snap/lxd/24322
  loop2 squash 4.0                                                            0   100% /snap/snapd/20290
  loop3                                                                       0   100% /snap/core20/2105
  loop4                                                                       0   100% /snap/snapd/20671
  loop5                                                                       0   100% /snap/lxd/26741

### Mounting the Block volume

Once you have created your filesystem, you need to define where you want to mount your volume and create a mount point (directory) for it.

1. Create the mount point. In this tutorial, we choose `/mnt/block-volume`.
    ```
    mkdir /mnt/block-volume
    ```
2. Mount the volume. We recommend that you use the `defaults` option, as in the command below.
    ```
    mount -o defaults /dev/sdb /mnt/block-volume
    ```

    ```sh no-copy
        **defaults**
              Use  the  default  options: **rw**, **suid**, **dev**,
              **exec**, **auto**, **nouser**, and **async**.
    ```

    If you want to see all available options, you can run `man mount` on your Instance.

3. Make sure your filesystem is properly mounted by running the `lsblk` command.
    ```
    lsblk
    ```

    You should see an output similar to the following. Check the `MOUNTPOINTS` field to ensure your volume is mounted where you intended it to be.

    ```sh no-copy
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    loop0     7:0    0  63.5M  1 loop /snap/core20/2015
    loop1     7:1    0  63.9M  1 loop /snap/core20/2105
    loop3     7:3    0 114.4M  1 loop /snap/lxd/26741
    loop4     7:4    0  40.9M  1 loop /snap/snapd/20290
    loop5     7:5    0  40.4M  1 loop /snap/snapd/20671
    loop6     7:6    0    87M  1 loop /snap/lxd/26881
    sda       8:0    0  23.3G  0 disk
    ├─sda1    8:1    0  23.2G  0 part /
    ├─sda14   8:14   0     4M  0 part
    └─sda15   8:15   0   106M  0 part /boot/efi
    sdb       8:32   0  27.9G  0 disk /mnt/block-volume
    ```

### Using fstab for Persistent Mounting

With the current configuration, your volume will not be mounted automatically upon reboot. Use the `/etc/fstab` file to make sure the reboot does not impact your filesystem.

Run the following command to make sure your volume is automatically mounted to your Instance upon reboot:

```
echo "UUID=$(blkid --output value /dev/sdb | head -n1) /mnt/block-volume ext4 defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
```

### Transferring data from your local machine to the remote Block volume

You may wish to transfer files from your local machine to your Instance's remote Block volume. This can be simply achieved with [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync), a tool for efficiently transferring and copying files. The rsync utility is pre-installed on most Linux distributions and macOS.

1. Check that rsync is installed on your local machine with the following command:
    ```
    rsync --version
    ```

    You should see an output similar to the following:

    ```sh no-copy
    rsync  version 3.1.3  protocol version 31
    Copyright (C) 1996-2018 by Andrew Tridgell, Wayne Davison, and others.
    Web site: http://rsync.samba.org/
    Capabilities:
        64-bit files, 64-bit inums, 64-bit timestamps, 64-bit long ints,
        socketpairs, hardlinks, symlinks, IPv6, batchfiles, inplace,
        append, ACLs, xattrs, iconv, symtimes, prealloc

    General Public Licence for details.
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
     If you get a `command not found` output (or similar), you need to install rsync. On Linux Ubuntu and Debian systems, you can do this with the APT package tool using the command `sudo apt install rsync`. For Linux CentOS/ Fedora, use the YUM package manager: `sudo yum install rsync`. On Mac OSX with the Homebrew package manager, use `brew install rsync`.
    </Message>
2. On your local machine, use nano to create a file called `hello-world.txt`:
    ```
    nano hello-world.txt
    ```

3. Enter the text `Hello World!`.
4. Press `Ctrl O`, `Enter`, and `Ctrl X` to save and exit the file.
5. Enter the following command to transfer the file to your Instance's mounted block volume. Ensure that you use your own Instance's IP address:
    ```
    rsync -a hello-world.txt root@<your_instance_ip>:/mnt/block-volume
    ```

The file is now transferred. You can connect to your Instance again, and use the command `cd /mnt/block-volume ; ls` to check that the file appears in the directory.

## Increasing the partition size of the volume

<Message type="important">
  - We recommend that you make a backup of your data using the [snapshot](/storage/block/how-to/create-a-snapshot/) feature, before increasing the partition size of your volume. This helps you avoid any potential data loss.
  - If the partition you want to resize is mounted, you need to [unmount it](/storage/block/api-cli/unmounting-a-volume/)
</Message>

1. Connect to your Instance using [SSH](/compute/instances/how-to/connect-to-instance/).
2. Use the `lsblk` command to identify your Block Storage volume's mount point. In the following example, the volume is mounted at `/mnt/block-volume`:
    ```
    root@scw-distracted-keldysh:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    loop0     7:0    0  63.5M  1 loop /snap/core20/2015
    loop1     7:1    0 111.9M  1 loop /snap/lxd/24322
    loop2     7:2    0  40.9M  1 loop /snap/snapd/20290
    loop3     7:3    0  63.9M  1 loop /snap/core20/2105
    loop4     7:4    0  40.4M  1 loop /snap/snapd/20671
    loop5     7:5    0 114.4M  1 loop /snap/lxd/26741
    sda       8:0    0  23.3G  0 disk
    ├─sda1    8:1    0  23.2G  0 part /
    ├─sda14   8:14   0     4M  0 part
    └─sda15   8:15   0   106M  0 part /boot/efi
    sdb       8:16   0  27.69  0 disk /mnt/block-volume
    ```

3. Use `growpart` to increase the partition size of your block storage volume (here `/dev/sdb1`):
    ```
    growpart /dev/sdb 1
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
      Take note of the space between the device identifier and the partition number.
    </Message>
4. Increase the partition size of the volume using `resize2fs`. Replace `/dev/sdX` with the name of your block volume in the following command:
    ```
    resize2fs -p /dev/sdX1
    ```
5. Check the new block volume size using `lsblk`:
    ```
    root@scw-distracted-keldysh:~# lsblk
    NAME    MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
    loop0     7:0    0  63.3M  1 loop /snap/core20/1852
    loop1     7:1    0 111.9M  1 loop /snap/lxd/24322
    loop2     7:2    0  49.8M  1 loop /snap/snapd/18596
    sda       8:0    0  18.6G  0 disk
    ├─sda1    8:1    0  18.5G  0 part /
    ├─sda14   8:14   0     4M  0 part
    └─sda15   8:15   0   106M  0 part /boot/efi
    ```
